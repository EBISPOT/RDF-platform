# EBI-rdf platform

This is the github repo for the EBI-RDF platform. The *master branch* shall contain useful information and tooling, while the *other branches* are used by different datasources to publish their VoID files! So basically other branches contain only two files, a (sourcename) void file and a test_void file. The test_void file simply only points to a partition of the data for test purposes. So the only real thing a dataprovide should care about is real, actual void file - this is the one you overwrite when you update your data! 

##Tooling
Find this folder in here for too useful scripts how to create and publish your VoID file! 

##VoID File:
Find the pdf document in this folder (with the incredible name "VoID file structure for the RDF platform.pdf") - it is descriping how the VoID has to be structured in order to be compatible with our minimum standards.
