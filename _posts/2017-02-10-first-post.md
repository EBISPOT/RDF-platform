EBI's RDF platform is released in a new layout, powered by a new infrastructure in the background. This is the beta release and if everything goes well, the old infrastructure will be replace in April 2017. We plan to release new features in the coming months as well as add new datasources soon! Read on for more information...

Until now the platform contained data from Ensembl, ChEMBL, Reactome, Biosamples, Biomodels and ArrayAtlas. The ArrayAtlas data was out of date and is replaced with a new version! Be aware that the data export was rewritten and therefore also the RDF Model changed slightly! Also, the RDF platform now host data from the Ontology Lookup Service, which means that more than 150 ontologies are now available in the platform.
