EBI's RDF platform is released in a new layout, powered by a new infrastructure. This is the beta release, the old infrastructure will be replace soon...

* New infrastructure:

* Updated Data:  Until now the platform contained data from Ensembl, ChEMBL, Reactome, Biosamples, Biomodels and ArrayAtlas. Some RDF data was out of data, we celebrate the release of the new platform with updated data for across the whole platform.

* New datasources: The RDF platform now host data from the **Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)**, which means that more than 150 ontologies are now available in the platform.

* New data export: Be aware that the existing data exports for some datasources (ExpressionAtlas) was re-written and therefore also the RDF Model changed slightly! We hope to improve the models in the future and if there are bigger changes, we will let you know.
