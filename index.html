	<p>The EBI RDF Platform aims to bring together the efforts of a number of EMBL-EBI resources that provide access to their data using Semantic Web technologies. It provides a unified way to query across resources using the W3C SPARQL query language. We welcome comments or questions via our feedback form.</p>
