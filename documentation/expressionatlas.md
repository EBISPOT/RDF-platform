# Expression Atlas RDF

The (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home)[Gene Expression Atlas] provides information on gene expression patterns under different biological conditions. Gene expression data is re-analysed in-house to detect genes showing interesting baseline and differential expression patterns. You can read more about the expression atlas data (here)[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/about.html]. 

This RDF version is generated from the Expression Atlas database with the (following scripts)[https://github.com/simonjupp/atlas-rdf]. The RDF version is still experimental and may not always reflect the latest data in the live expression atlas. We welcome feedback on the utility of this dataset so please (get in touch)[https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/feedback-form]

Please note: this version of the expression atlas is different from the gene expression atlas data that was previoulsy loaded into the RDF platform in 2013. That dataset represented the onld GXA data that has since been retired in 2013. This new version contains both baseline and differential expression data and the RDF schema has changed to reflect this. The final release of the ols GXA data was 13.07 and is available to download from the (FTP site)[ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases//microarray/data/gxa/rdf]
