Documentation for the BioModels Linked Dataset

BioModels linked data set contains all curated and non curated SBML models in the BioModels repository in RDF. Each SBML element is captured as a RDF class. The parent-child relationships between the elements and the attributes are captured using RDF properties. An additional property is introduced to capture the curated and non-curated status of each model. The diagrams below show a detailed diagramatic representation of the schema.
