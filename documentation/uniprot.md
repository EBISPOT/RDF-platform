## Uniprot
UniProt Consortium is publishing its data in RDF since 2008. However Uniprot runs its own [sparql endpoint](http://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql) located in Switzerland and is therefore not directly part of the RDF platform. The data is also available via [ftp](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/rdf/). For questions concerning uniprot, please use their [contact form](http://www.uniprot.org/contact).

However, keep in mind that it's possible to combine RDF resources via [federated sparql queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/)!
