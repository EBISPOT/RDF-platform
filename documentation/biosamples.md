## Documentation Biosamples

The schema for the Biosamples dataset, shown below mostly reflects the SampleTab format and the entities that can be seen from the Biosamples web site. We have achieved such result by trying to reuse existing ontologies as much as possible. However, we have defined a small application ontology for covering those concepts and relationships specific to the Biosamples dataset.

Beyond ontologies used for the core entities, there is a number of biomedical ontologies which are automatically assigned to textual elements by the Zooma tool. For instance, if a sample record in the Biosamples Database is annotated with a 'Characteristic[Organism]' having the value of mus-musculus, Zooma creates a property value that is an OWL individual and is instance of the term 10090 from the NCBI Taxon ontology.

#### SPARQL endpoint

This is the main interface to the Biosamples RDF dataset and it is available here.

PLEASE NOTE: for reasons we are investigating, no query that begins with a SPARQL comments currently work with our endpoints. That is the reason why examples below have header comments after the prefix definitions.

#### Example Queries

Please see the link above about the SPARQL endpoint for a list of query examples.

#### Downloads

Here you find the files that the Biosamples dataset consists of. They are organised on a per-version basis and the folder about each version contains all the files that were uploaded on our triple store, including those coming from third parties, such as ontology files.

Biosamples triples were generated by means of our RDF exporter, which, in turn, is based on a generic library for mapping Java classes to OWL/RDF classes and statements.

#### Limits

Please note that the Biosamples RDF dataset is experimental and it has currently some limits:

    It is not completely aligned with the data in the web site
    Some data have still to be reviewed and refined (e.g., Zooma annotations).
