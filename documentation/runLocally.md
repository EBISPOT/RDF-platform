## Running our SPARQL endpoints locally <a name="Running-our-SPARQL-endpoints-locally"></a>

If you would like more control over access to the EMBL-EBI RDF data, or perhaps to combine it with other RDF data, you can run your own SPARQL endpoint. You can download the RDF data dump for each data source from our ftp.
