## Ontology Lookups Service Documentation

The [Ontology Lookup Service](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/) (OLS) is a repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a single point of access to the latest ontology versions. The ontology lookup service contains more than 150 ontologies and is updated nightly. To have a common set of ontologies in the RDF platform helps to connect the data from other providers and offers in addition the posibility to use SPARQL to access these ontologies.   

Ontologies that are published in OWL can be directly imported into the RDF platform. Ontologies in other formats (e.g. OBO) are converted to OWL with the JENA API before they are imported into the RDF platform.
