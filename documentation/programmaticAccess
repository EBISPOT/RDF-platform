## Programmatic access

The SPARQL services can be access programatically over HTTP. Query results are available in a variety of standard formats including SPARQL XML, SPARQL JSON, CSV and TSV. 

Luckily you don't have to worry about the low level details of connecting and parsing the output from your favourite programming language because a wide range of APIs are availble for interacting with a SPARQL endpoint. Here we list some popular APIs for a given programming language.

#### Perl APIs

#### Java APIs
