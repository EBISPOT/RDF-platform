        "The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis.  This comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something, such as differently evolved versions of a protein.  In this kind of analysis, the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic Units).  The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities.  The features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'.  For a given character, such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'.  The differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with a phylogenetic tree.  CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters.  The representation of characters and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character." ;

        """The MIAPA ontology is intended to be an application ontology for the purpose of semantic annotation of phylogenetic data according to the requirements and recommendations of the Minimum Information for A Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA) metadata reporting standard. The ontology leverages (imports) primarily from the CDAO (Comparative Data Analysis Ontology), PROV (W3C Provenance Ontology), and SWO (Software Ontology, which includes the EDAM ontologies) ontologies. It adds some assertions of its own, as well as some classes and individuals that may eventually get pushed down into one of the respective source ontologies.

This ontology is maintained at http://github.com/miapa/miapa, and requests for changes or additions should be filed at the issue tracker there. The discussion list is at miapa-discuss@googlegroups.com. Further resources about MIAPA can be found at the project's main page at http://evoio.org/wiki/MIAPA.""" ;

Eppig, as part of the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) Project, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. This file contains pre-coordinated phenotype terms, definitions and synonyms that can be used to describe mammalian phenotypes. The ontology is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It organizes phenotype terms into major biological system headers such as nervous system and respiratory system.  This ontology is currently under development. Weekly updates are available at the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) ftp site (ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/index.html#pheno) as well as the OBO Foundry site (http://obofoundry.org/). Questions, comments and suggestions are welcome, and should be directed to pheno@jax.org, Susan.Bello@jax.org or to GitHub tracker (https://github.com/obophenotype/mammalian-phenotype-ontology/issues) MGD is funded by NIH/NHGRI grant HG000330." ;

    dct:description "The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis.  This comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something, such as differently evolved versions of a protein.  In this kind of analysis, the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic Units).  The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities.  The features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'.  For a given character, such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'.  The differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with a phylogenetic tree.  CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters.  The representation of characters and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character." ;

This file contains pre-coordinated phenotype terms, definitions and synonyms that can be used to describe mammalian phenotypes. The ontology is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It organizes phenotype terms into major biological system headers such as nervous system and respiratory system.  This ontology is currently under development. Weekly updates are available at the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) ftp site (ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/index.html#pheno) as well as the OBO Foundry site (http://obofoundry.org/).

    dct:description "The Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a biomedical ontology in the domain of vaccine and vaccination. VO aims to standardize vaccine annotation, integrate various vaccine data, and support computer-assisted reasoning.  VO supports basic vaccine R&D and clincal vaccine usage. VO is initiated and primarily developed by Dr. Yongqun \"Oliver\" He at the University of Michigan Medical School. VO is being developed as a community-based ontology with support and collaborations from the vaccine and bio-ontology communities." ;
