	<h2>RDF Services</h2>
	With our RDF platform, our main goal is to provide programmatic access to Linked Data versions of a select number of datasets. We do this by providing a number of services.
Summary of Services</p>
<p>This table provides a summary of the available datasets:</p>

| Dataset | Version | Date Updated | Number of Triples | Dataset description
| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
| Biomodels | 28 | Sep 22, 2014 | 174,156,700 | http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/biomodels/28|

<p>
These are all complete versions of their respective parent databases.

Other EBI resources may be included in the future. If you would like to see data from a particular EBI resource, please let us know.

Please note also that some EBI resources may operate pilot or beta programs producing linked data that are additional to those listed here. EBI may also be involved in collaborations that produce linked data. These should be considered as additional resources; the RDF Platform by contrast aims to offer a consistent and stable set of services.
</p>

<h4>How can the data be used?</h4>
<p>There are four main ways to access the RDF data:</p>

<h4>Bulk Download</h4>
<p>Downloads of entire datasets are available in compressed RDF format from the EBI public FTP site:</p>

ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/RDF/
<h4>On-Demand Download</h4>
<p>Much of our RDF data can also be downloaded on a per-resource basis (e.g. an individual ChEMBL target) using content negotiation.</p>
<h4>SPARQL Access</h4>
<p>
We provide programmatic access to the data via our SPARQL endpoints, which are open to the public. You can run queries directly against the datasets remotely, including federated queries that span more than one endpoint.

Please note that we will be reviewing the level of public access to these endpoints that is feasible. It may be necessary to restrict certain queries in order to maintain a consistent level of service, for example.</p>
<h4>Linked Data Browser</h4>
<p>
You can browse across the RDF data through your web browser using our Linked Data browser software. This allows you to get an idea of the data contained within the various datasets, and navigate the links between them.</p>
